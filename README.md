### Omega

Omega is a cheat made for the popular game CSGO. 
While it is not the best one, it serves extremely well for legit cheating.
It is also not very safe and very likely to get you VAC banned,
so don't use it on an account you care about.
I will not be held accountable for any bans that may occur,
while using Omega.
